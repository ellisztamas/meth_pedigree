Scripts to randomise positions of plants in each generation.

The top level gives scripts to do this, which are saved to 'output'.
Note that those output files have been edited by hand to add additional
information, like where samples should be in sequencing plate, but running the
scripts again would erase those data. So, appended files were saved with new
file names giving the data when the plants were sown.

We also took photographs of the trays at the F2 generation, in the 'photos' folder
