Script to check that the samples are what I think they are.

The general idea is to align raw reads to the TAIR10 reference genome, call
genotypes at SNPs that vary between the four parents, then to plot how similar
each sample is to what I think the parents are.

Results of validation are given in 09_validation_results.Rmd.
