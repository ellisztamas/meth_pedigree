Folder to contain scripts and output files for processing RNA seq data. These data have not arrived yet, so this readme is a placeholder.

I suggest we keep a clear structure to this folder that keeps scripts and the files they generate together. For example:

```
01_methylseq
    - script-to-do-it.sh
    - output_folder
02_snpmatch
    - script-to-do-it.sh
    - output_folder
03_mean_methylation_levels
    - script-to-do-it.sh
    - output_folder
```
